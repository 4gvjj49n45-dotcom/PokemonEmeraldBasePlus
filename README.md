### Quick use items
You can spam use items on Pokemon. As long as you still have more of the item left in your bag, you will not be kicked out of the party menu screen when using them. Spam candies to your hearts desire!

### No HM slaves required
Upon earning their respective badge, the field effect of HMs is automatically triggered based on the context. For example, cut trees are immediately cut when interacted with upon defeating Roxanne.

### Faster fishing
Fishing now guarantees an encounter and only has 1 sequence of dots appear before transitioning to the battle.

### Patch guy NPC
Interacting with this NPC (in prof. Birch's lab) ensures your key items match what the patch expects. He also let's you set your EV, TM, and berry mode.
